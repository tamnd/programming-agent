## In plain words

You look for a word in a printed dictionary. You do not read each page. You open the book at the middle. If your word comes before the words on that page, you keep the first half. If it comes after, you keep the second half. You do the same step again on the half that you keep. Each step removes half of the pages, so you find the word after a small number of steps.

Binary search does this on a sorted array. It compares the key with the middle item. The result of the comparison tells which half can hold the key. The algorithm stops when it finds the key, or when no items are left.

## The problem

The input is an array $A[0 \ldots n-1]$ of $n$ items in non-decreasing order, and a key $x$. The output is an index $i$ with $A[i] = x$, or NIL when no item is equal to $x$. This is the problem [search in a sorted array](/search-in-sorted-array/). When the array has more than one copy of $x$, any index of a copy is a correct answer.

The algorithm only compares items. It does not do arithmetic on them. So it works for numbers, strings and any other type with a total order.

## The algorithm

The algorithm keeps a range of indices $[lo, hi)$. The key can only be at an index in this range. At the start, the range is the full array.

```pseudo id=main
BINARY-SEARCH(A, x)
L1  lo ← 0, hi ← n                    ▷ the range is A[lo .. hi − 1]
L2  while lo < hi do
L3      mid ← lo + ⌊(hi − lo) / 2⌋     ▷ no overflow, unlike ⌊(lo + hi) / 2⌋
L4      if A[mid] < x then
L5          lo ← mid + 1                ▷ x is not in A[lo .. mid]
L6      else if A[mid] > x then
L7          hi ← mid                    ▷ x is not in A[mid .. hi − 1]
L8      else return mid
L9  return NIL
```

Line L3 picks the middle of the range. Lines L4 to L8 compare $A[mid]$ with $x$. If $A[mid] < x$, then each item at an index of $mid$ or less is less than $x$, because the array is sorted. So line L5 removes these indices from the range. Line L7 does the same on the other side. Line L9 runs when the range is empty.

## Example

The array is $A = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]$, with $n = 10$. A search for $x = 23$ takes one step. The first middle item is $A[5] = 23$, so the algorithm returns 5.

A search for $x = 30$ takes four steps:

| step | lo | hi | mid | $A[mid]$ | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 10 | 5 | 23 | $23 < 30$, so $lo \gets 6$ |
| 2 | 6 | 10 | 8 | 72 | $72 > 30$, so $hi \gets 8$ |
| 3 | 6 | 8 | 7 | 56 | $56 > 30$, so $hi \gets 7$ |
| 4 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 38 | $38 > 30$, so $hi \gets 6$ |

Now $lo = hi = 6$. The range is empty, so the algorithm returns NIL. The index 6 is the place where 30 can go to keep the array sorted.

## Correctness

The proof uses a [loop invariant](/loop-invariant/). Before each test of line L2, this statement is true:

> If $x$ is in $A$, then $x$ is in $A[lo \ldots hi-1]$.

At the start, the range is the full array, so the statement is true. Each step keeps it true, because lines L5 and L7 only remove indices that cannot hold $x$. Each step also makes the range smaller, because $lo \le mid < hi$. So the loop stops. When line L8 returns, $A[mid] = x$. When line L9 returns, the range is empty, and by the invariant $x$ is not in $A$. The full proof is below.

## Complexity

Let $k$ be the size $hi - lo$ of the range. One step of the loop makes the new size at most $\lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. So after $t$ steps the size is at most $\lfloor n / 2^t \rfloor$, and the loop runs at most $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor + 1$ times. Each step does one three-way comparison of $A[mid]$ with $x$, and a fixed number of other operations.

- The time in the worst case is $\Theta(\log n)$. The worst case is a key that is not in the array.
- The time in the best case is $\Theta(1)$. The key is the first middle item.
- The extra space is $\Theta(1)$: three indices.

In the [comparison model](/comparison-model/), each algorithm for this problem needs $\lceil \lg(n+1) \rceil$ three-way comparisons in the worst case. The argument uses a decision tree: the tree must tell apart the $n$ positions of $x$ and the case "not found". Because $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor + 1 = \lceil \lg(n+1) \rceil$, binary search is optimal in this model.

## Variants and improvements

- **Lower bound.** Return the first index $i$ with $A[i] \ge x$. This answers "where does $x$ go" and "how many items are less than $x$". Remove line L8, change line L6 to "else $hi \gets mid$", and return $lo$ at line L9. The C++ function `std::lower_bound` and the Python function `bisect.bisect_left` do this.
- **Upper bound.** Return the first index $i$ with $A[i] > x$. The number of copies of $x$ is the upper bound minus the lower bound.
- **Search on the answer.** Use the same loop on any predicate that is false and then true over a range of integers. This finds the smallest value that satisfies the predicate.
- **Exponential search.** When $n$ is not known, or the key is near the start, test the indices $1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots$ first. Then do a binary search in the last interval. The time is $O(\log i)$ for a key at index $i$.
- **Interpolation search.** Guess the index from the values, as a person does with a phone book. On uniform data the average time is $O(\log \log n)$, but the worst case is $O(n)$.

## When to use it

Use binary search when the data is sorted and does not change often, and you search it many times. If the data changes often, a balanced search tree or a hash table is better. A hash table also answers a search in $O(1)$ expected time, but it cannot answer "which is the next larger item". If you search an array only once, a linear scan in $O(n)$ costs less than a sort in $O(n \log n)$ followed by a binary search.

## Pitfalls

- **Overflow.** The expression $\lfloor (lo + hi)/2 \rfloor$ can overflow a fixed-size integer when the array is very large. This bug was in the Java library for nine years. Use $lo + \lfloor (hi - lo)/2 \rfloor$, as line L3 does.
- **An infinite loop.** With a closed range $[lo, hi]$, the update "$lo \gets mid$" can keep the range the same size. Each update must remove $mid$, or the range must be half-open as here.
- **An off-by-one error.** Decide if $hi$ is in the range or not, and use the same rule in each line.
- **Unsorted input.** On an array that is not sorted, the result has no meaning. The algorithm does not detect this.

## Implementations

## History

John Mauchly described binary search in the Moore School Lectures in 1946. The first published version that works for each $n$, not only for $n = 2^k - 1$, is by Derrick Henry Lehmer in 1960. Knuth says that the idea is simple, but the details are hard. Jon Bentley found that most professional programmers in his courses wrote a binary search with a bug. In 2006 Joshua Bloch showed the overflow bug of the midpoint in the Java library.
